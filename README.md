## Overview/Reason 

Poverty, unemployment, and lack of affordable housing are commonly recognized causes of homelessness. These risk factors can be exacerbated by personal vulnerabilities such as mental and substance use disorders, trauma and violence, domestic violence, justice-system involvement, sudden serious illness, divorce, death of a partner, and disabilities.
Cell phones are a great way to locate resources that can help people rise out of homelessness.  This application seeks to help find open shelters in a person's region along with basic resources someone that is unsheltered might need.
